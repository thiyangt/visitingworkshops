## Population

A population is a complete collection of individuals/ objects that we are interested in.

## Sample

 A sample is a subset of a population.
 
---

## Parameter

A parameter is a descriptive measure(numerical value) of the population. Parameters are usually denoted by Greek letters.

$\theta$ - population proportion

$\mu$ - population mean

---

## Statistic

A statistic is a descriptive measure of a sample. For example, sample mean, sample standard deviation, etc. We will talk about the notations under estimator and estimate.

---
## Variables

**1. Qualitative/ Categorical**

- Nominal, Ordinal

**2. Quantitative/ Numerical**

- Discrete, Continuous

"If R were **an airplane**, RStudio would be **the airport**, providing many, many supporting services that make it easier for you, the pilot, to take off and go to awesome places. Sure, you can fly an airplane without an airport, but having those runways and supporting infrastructure is a game-changer."

## Comment your code

- Each line of a comment should begin with the comment symbol and a single space: # . 

```{r, comment=NA}
rnorm(10) # This is a comment 
sum(1:10) # 1+2
```

---

## Style Guide

- Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread.  -- Hadley Wickham

```{r, comment=NA}
sum(1:10)#Bad commenting style
sum(1:10) # Good commenting style

```

- Also, use commented lines of - and = to break up your file into easily readable sub-sections.

```r
# Read data ----------------

# Plot data ----------------
```

## Objects in R

- R is an [object-oriented language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).

--
- An object in R is anything (data structures, functions, etc., that can be assigned to a variable).

---

Let's take a look of some common types of objects.

--

**1. Data structures** are the ways of arranging data.

  - You can create objects, using the left pointing arrow <-
---

**2. Functions** tell R to do something.

  - A function may be applied to an object.

  - Result of applying a function is usually an object too.

    - All function calls need to be followed by parentheses.
    
---

## Example

```{r, comment=NA}
a <- 1:20 # data structure
sum(a) # sum is a function applied on a

```

```r
help.start() # Some functions work on their own.
```


---

# Getting help with functions and features

- R has inbuilt help facility


### Method 1

```r
help(rnorm)
```

- For a feature specified by special characters such as `for`, `if`, `[[`

```r
help("[[")
```

---

- Search the help files for a word or phrase.

```r
help.search(‘weighted mean’) 
```

### Method 2

```r
?rnorm
```

```r
??rnorm
```

## Data structures

.footer-note[.tiny[.green[Image Credit: ][venus.ifca.unican.es](http://venus.ifca.unican.es/Rintro/dataStruct.html)]]



---

## Data structures

Data structures differ in terms of,

- Type of data they can hold

- How they are created

- Structural complexity

- Syntax to identify and access individual elements

---
class: duke-green, center, middle

# 1. Vectors

---

# Vectors

- Vectors are one-dimensional arrays that can hold numeric data, character data, or logical data.

- Combine function c() is used to form the vector.

- Data in a vector must only be one type or mode (numeric, character, or logical). You can’t mix modes in the same vector.

---

## Vector assignment

**Syntax**

```r
vector_name <- c(element1, element2, element3)

```

```r
x <- c(5, 6, 3, 1 , 100)
```

- assignment operator ('<-'), '=' can be used as an alternative.

- `c()` function

---

.red[What will be the output of the following code?]

```r
y <- c(x, 500, 600)
```

---

# Types and tests with vectors


```{r, eval=TRUE}
first_vec <- c(10, 20, 50, 70)
second_vec <- c("Jan", "Feb", "March", "April")
third_vec <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
fourth_vec <- c(10L, 20L, 50L, 70L)
```


To check if it is a 

- vector: `is.vector()`

```{r, comment=NA}
is.vector(first_vec)
```

---

- charactor vector: `is.charactor()`

```{r, comment=NA}
is.character(first_vec)
```

- double: `is.double()`

```{r, comment=NA}
is.double(first_vec)
```

---

- integer: `is.integer()`

```{r, comment=NA}
is.integer(first_vec)
```


--

- logical: `is.logical()`

```{r, comment=NA}
is.logical(first_vec)
```

---

- length

```{r, comment=NA}
length(first_vec)
```
---

# Coercion

Vectors must be homogeneous. When you attempt to combine different types they will be coerced to the most flexible type so that every element in the vector is of the same type.

Order from least to most flexible

`logical` --> `integer` --> `double` --> `character`

---


```{r, comment=NA}
a <- c(3.1, 2L, 3, 4, "GPA") 
typeof(a) 
```

```{r, comment=NA}
anew <- c(3.1, 2L, 3, 4)
typeof(anew) 
```

---

### Explicit coercion

Vectors can be explicitly coerced from one class to another using the `as.*` functions, if available. For example, `as.charactor`, `as.numeric`, `as.integer`, and `as.logical`.

---


```{r, comment=NA}
vec1 <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
typeof(vec1)

vec2 <- as.integer(vec1)
typeof(vec2)
vec2
```

---

.red[Why does the below output NAs?]

```{r, comment=NA}
x <- c("a", "b", "c")
as.numeric(x)
```

---

.pull-left[

```{r, comment=NA}
x1 <- 1:3
x2 <- c(10, 20, 30)
combinedx1x2 <- c(x1, x2)
combinedx1x2 
```

]
--

.pull-right[

```{r, comment=NA}
class(x1)
class(x2)
class(combinedx1x2)

```

]


---

- If you combine a numeric vector and a character vector 

```{r, comment=NA}
y1 <- c(1, 2, 3)
y2 <- c("a", "b", "c")
c(y1, y2)

```

---

# Name elements in a vector

You can name elements in a vector in different ways. We will learn two of them.

When creating it

```{r}
x1 <- c(a=1991, b=1992, c=1993)
x1
```

---

Modifying the names of an existing vector

```{r}
x2 <- c(1, 5, 10)
names(x2) <- c("a", "b", "b")
x2
```

Note that the names do not have to be unique. 

---

# To remove names of a vector

Method 1

```{r, comment=NA}
unname(x1); x1
```

---

Method 2

```{r, comment=NA}
names(x2) <- NULL; x2
```

What will be the output of the following code?

```r
v <- c(1, 2, 3)
names(v) <- c("a")
v
```
---

### Simplifying vector creation

- colon `:` produce regular spaced ascending or descending sequences.

```{r, comment=NA}
 10:16

-0.5:8.5

```
---
- sequence: `seq(initial_value, final_value, increment)`

```{r, comment=NA}
seq(1,11)

seq(1, 11, length.out=5)

seq(0, 11, by=2)
```

---

- repeats `rep()` 

```{r, comment=NA}
rep(9, 5)

rep(1:4, 2)

rep(1:4, each=2) # each element is repeated twice
```

---

```{r, comment=NA}
rep(1:4, times=2) # whole sequence is repeated twice

rep(1:4, each=2, times=3)

rep(1:4, 1:4)

rep(1:4, c(4, 1, 4, 2))

```

---

## Logical operators

```{r, comment=NA}
c(1, 2, 3) == c(10, 20, 3)
```

```{r, comment=NA}
c(1, 2, 3) != c(10, 20, 3)
```

```{r, comment=NA}
1:5 > 3
```

```{r, comment=NA}
1:5 < 3
```

- `<=` less than or equal to

# Operators: `%in%` - in the set

```{r, comment=NA}
a <- c(1, 2, 3)
b <- c(1, 10, 3)
a%in%b
```

```{r, comment=NA}
x <- 1:10
y <- 1:3
```

```{r, comment=NA}

y
x %in% y

```{r, comment=NA}
y %in% x

## Vector arithmetic


- operations are perfored element by element. 

```{r, comment=NA}
c(10, 100, 100) + 2 # two is added to every element in the vector
```
--
- operations between two vectors

```{r, comment=NA}
v1 <- c(1, 2, 3); v2 <- c(10, 100, 1000)
v1 + v2
```

---

Add two vectors of unequal length

```{r, comment=NA}
longvec <- seq(10, 100, length=10); shortvec <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

shortvec + longvec

```


.red[What will be the output of the following code?]

```r
first <- c(1, 2, 3, 4); second <- c(10, 100)
first * second
```
