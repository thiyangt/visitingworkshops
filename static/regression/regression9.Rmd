## Introduction

---

## Variance-Stabilizing Transformations

---

## Transformations to Linearize the Model

---

## Transformations on Y

- To correct nonnormality assumption and/or nonconstant variance assumption of the error term.

## Box-Cox Method

---

## Transformations on X

- Suppose the assumption of normally and independently distributed responses with constant variance are at least approximately satisfied, however the relationship between $Y$ and one or more of the regressor variables is nonlinear.
